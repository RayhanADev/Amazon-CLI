# Amazon CLI*
##### *Unofficial

Ever had that moment when you’re coding and then you think *Wait, I really need this Amazon thing*, but are too lazy to navigate to Amazon? Well this NodeJS project uses an Amazon Scraper to make getting Amazon products **easy from the comfort of your console**! No more waiting for Amazon to load, scrolling through the many distracting pages, then giving up. **Simply select search features, your type of search, and your product name and get near-instant results**.

## Features:
- Search by country and category
- Find amount of product
- Find average price of product
- Find average reviews for product
- Find links to product
- Up-to-date & current!

## Beta:
This is a beta version, so you may find ~~numerous~~ bugs! Please tell me in the issues or create a pull request with a suggestion! Any UI suggestions are also appreciated, I used console-colors to make it look pretty but it could use some work.

### Copyright, Affiliation, etc.
I am in no way associated with Amazon, and this program is not an official Amazon project. Simply made for fun and only uses public data! I also don’t use any Amazon affiliation links, so I make no profit from this. Purely for you.
